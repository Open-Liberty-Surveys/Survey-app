# Survey-app
Social Media Application made for my software engineering class with IBM's Open Liberty Software using microservice architecture.

This project was made by myself and two teammates. There are two microservices that were made for this project, the one I created is the "Webapp" service.
You can run this service, which is an Open Liberty server, by entering the folder "WebappService" and running the command Run ng serve for a dev server, then Navigate to http://localhost:4200/
You will need to have AngularJS installed to run the server
The webapp itself is made using AngularJS, and connects to the survay service to display information to the user. I created 8 components that are utilized on the webpage, here are some screenshots for reference:
